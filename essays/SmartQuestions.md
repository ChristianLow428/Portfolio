## Intro to Smart Questions 
I believe that communication is one of the most vital skills a software engineer can develop. In a community that relies on teamwork, effective communication determines the quality and speed of assistance that a person receives. I was introduced to Eric Raymond’s essay, How to Ask Questions the Smart Way, which provides guidelines on formulating questions that maximize the chances of receiving high-quality answers. This essay examines two StackOverflow questions one that follows Raymond’s principles and another that does not.
 

## Smart Question
This user asks about their program that deletes extra white space from a string. They state, "I wrote this code, which works until I have to change the passed pointer's address to the new string I made in the function. I have read that this it's not possible without making a pointer to a pointer. The problem is, for my assignment, I can't change the argument types."

## Why it is a Smart Question
One of the strongest aspects of this question is its clarity. The user states the goal of removing extra spaces from a string while ensuring that a single space remains between words. They also clearly articulate the challenge: they cannot modify the argument types, which prevents them from using a pointer-to-pointer approach. They don't just state that their code does not work, they also explain why they believe their approach is incorrect. Another reason is that the user provides a full code snippet. So this makes it much easier for others to identify potential errors and offer precise feedback. Finally, this question is genuine and reflects a willingness to learn. The user doesn't post an error message and ask for a direct fix, they attempt to debug their code and reason through their issue logically. The mindset to learn is essential for software engineering. In summary, this is a smart question because it is clear, well-structured, and demonstrates effort, understanding, and a willingness to explore multiple solutions. This type of question reflects the best practices of problem-solving in programming.
