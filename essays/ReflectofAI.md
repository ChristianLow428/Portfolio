## I. Introduction
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming the landscape of education, particularly in fields like Software Engineering where automation, optimization, and intelligent assistance can directly influence how students learn and build software. AI tools such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Cursor have become increasingly relevant by offering real-time code suggestions, explanations, and debugging support. In ICS 314, I have made use of ChatGPT and Cursor AI to assist me in understanding programming concepts, generating code snippets, and refining my problem-solving approaches. These tools have complemented the curriculum by enhancing how I interact with code and how I grasp software engineering principles.

## II. Personal Experience with AI
1. Experience WODs (e.g., E18)
For the E18 WOD, which focused on implementing a Meteor-based form, I used ChatGPT to ask: “How do I create a reactive form using Meteor and Semantic UI?” The response gave me a rough structure, including use of AutoForm and SimpleSchema. While the generated solution wasn’t a perfect fit, it gave me a helpful starting point and increased my confidence in tackling the problem. However, I still needed to adjust the code significantly to align it with the specific requirements of the WOD.

2. In-class Practice WODs
During practice WODs, I used GitHub Copilot in VSCode. For example, while building a component to display user profiles, Copilot would automatically suggest function names and complete map() calls for lists. These suggestions often saved time, although I sometimes had to verify correctness and ensure the code matched class guidelines and best practices.

3. In-class WODs
For timed in-class WODs, I chose not to use AI tools. I wanted to test my raw understanding of the concepts under pressure, and using AI felt like it would defeat the purpose of the exercise. This decision helped me evaluate my readiness and strengthened my problem-solving skills without external aid.

4. Essays
For writing essays, especially the ethical reflection essay, I used ChatGPT to help brainstorm ideas. I prompted it with: “Give me arguments for and against ethical considerations in open-source software.” While the response gave me a broad overview, I had to do more specific research and write the essay myself. ChatGPT helped get past the initial writer’s block but was not useful for detailed course-specific arguments.

5. Final Project
While building the final project, I used ChatGPT to help troubleshoot a bug in our Meteor server method. I asked, “Why does Meteor method throw unauthorized error when user is logged in?” The AI pointed me toward checking this.userId, which helped us resolve the issue quickly. In this case, AI was very helpful in narrowing down the root cause and saved valuable debugging time.

6. Learning a concept / tutorial
When I was learning about reactive variables and session state, I used ChatGPT to ask: “What is the difference between ReactiveVar and Session in Meteor?” The explanation was clear and concise, which improved my understanding beyond what was covered in the tutorial videos.

7. Answering a question in class or in Discord
I occasionally used AI to fact-check my responses before posting in Discord. For instance, when someone asked about the purpose of Meteor.publish, I confirmed my answer by asking ChatGPT for a brief definition. This gave me more confidence that I was sharing accurate information.

8. Asking or answering a smart-question
Before asking a smart question in class, I sometimes used ChatGPT to refine how I was framing the issue. For example, I typed: “How do I word a question about Meteor’s asynchronous data loading affecting component rendering?” This helped me clarify what I was struggling with and ask a more precise question during office hours.

9. Coding example (e.g., 'give an example of using Underscore .pluck')
When reviewing functional programming, I asked ChatGPT, “Give an example of using underscore.js .pluck with an array of objects.” It generated a working example that demonstrated the core functionality. This was particularly useful for quickly visualizing how a method worked before I used it in a WOD.

10. Explaining code
While reviewing past code, I sometimes used ChatGPT to help me understand unfamiliar lines. For example, I input: “What does this line of code mean in JavaScript: items.map(item => item.name)?” The explanation helped reinforce my understanding of arrow functions and mapping over arrays.

11. Writing code
I used GitHub Copilot extensively when writing repetitive functions in our project. For instance, while writing form validation methods, Copilot often completed my if statements and return lines correctly. It boosted my efficiency but also sometimes generated incorrect assumptions, requiring me to stay alert and correct those.

12. Documenting code
For documentation, I asked ChatGPT, “Write a JS docstring for a function that filters users by role.” The result was well-structured and followed common conventions, which made it easier to maintain clear, consistent comments across our codebase.

13. Quality assurance (e.g., 'What’s wrong with this code <code here>' or 'Fix the ESLint errors in <code here>')
When dealing with ESLint issues, I pasted snippets into ChatGPT and asked, “Fix the ESLint errors in this code.” It usually worked well for basic formatting problems but sometimes introduced changes that didn’t follow our style guide, so I had to review everything before using it.

14. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed
I also used ChatGPT to create visual metaphors or analogies for explaining difficult topics. For example, I asked: “Explain reactive programming using a kitchen analogy.” The response helped me solidify my mental model and even helped peers understand it better when I shared the metaphor.

III. Impact on Learning and Understanding
AI tools have had a meaningful impact on how I learn. By offering immediate feedback and multiple perspectives on problems, AI enhanced my ability to comprehend challenging topics. However, I also noticed a tendency to rely on AI too early, which sometimes disrupted the deeper learning process. Over time, I learned to balance AI assistance with independent problem-solving. The combination of both improved my coding efficiency, debugging skills, and overall confidence in handling software engineering tasks.

IV. Practical Applications
Outside of ICS 314, I used AI tools in the HACC (Hawaii Annual Code Challenge) to brainstorm features and debug Firebase issues. For example, in our group project, I used ChatGPT to quickly generate a schema for a Firestore collection based on user input needs. This saved time and helped us maintain momentum. I also used GitHub Copilot when creating REST APIs, where it often correctly predicted route handlers based on comments. These tools proved valuable in real-world settings, especially when working under time constraints.

V. Challenges and Opportunities
One major challenge with using AI is its unpredictability. Sometimes the solutions were outdated or made assumptions that didn’t match my code context. Another limitation was the temptation to copy solutions instead of fully understanding them. However, AI also presents major opportunities for personalized learning, real-time debugging, and scaffolding for new learners. If integrated wisely, it can enhance both teaching and student outcomes.

VI. Comparative Analysis
Compared to traditional teaching methods, AI tools offer faster feedback, greater accessibility, and more diverse explanations. However, they lack the personalized mentorship and critical thinking emphasis that in-person instruction provides. AI tools shine when used as supplements—not substitutes—for lectures, peer collaboration, and guided learning. They are especially helpful in reinforcing concepts after class and providing support during solo study.

## VII. Future Considerations
In the future, I believe AI will play a larger role in software engineering education. Potential advancements could include AI teaching assistants that monitor student progress and offer personalized practice problems. However, challenges like academic integrity, overreliance, and maintaining deep understanding will need to be addressed. Incorporating AI ethics into the curriculum and teaching students how to use AI responsibly will be essential.

## VIII. Conclusion
Overall, AI has been a powerful companion in my journey through ICS 314. It helped me write, debug, understand, and document code more effectively. While it is not a replacement for human instruction or effort, it offers tremendous potential when used mindfully. I recommend that future courses continue to embrace AI—but with strong guidance to ensure that students remain actively engaged in their learning process.
