## Intro to Smart Questions 
I believe that communication is one of the most vital skills a software engineer can develop. In a community that relies on teamwork, effective communication determines the quality and speed of assistance that a person receives. I was introduced to Eric Raymond’s essay, How to Ask Questions the Smart Way, which provides guidelines on formulating questions that maximize the chances of receiving high-quality answers. This essay examines two StackOverflow questions one that follows Raymond’s principles and another that does not.
 

## Smart Question
This user asks about their program that deletes extra white space from a string. They state, "I wrote this code, which works until I have to change the passed pointer's address to the new string I made in the function. I have read that this is not possible without making a pointer to a pointer. The problem is, for my assignment, I can't change the argument types."
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79401708/change-pointer-adress-inside-function-in-c" target="_blank">Change pointer address inside function in C</a>
