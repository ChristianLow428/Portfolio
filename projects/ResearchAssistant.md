The research project focused on evaluating the quality of code produced by Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT. The goal was to analyze how well these models generate code, particularly in real-world applications, by extracting code snippets from a repository of ChatGPT conversations. These snippets were then processed and stored in a MySQL database for further analysis. By using Python and pandas, we were able to clean, manipulate, and organize the data to assess factors such as correctness, efficiency, and adherence to coding best practices. The findings were expected to contribute to a deeper understanding of how LLMs perform in generating high-quality code and where improvements may be needed.

In this project, I was responsible for the data extraction and processing tasks. I used Python scripts to access the repository of ChatGPT conversations and employed pandas to manage and clean the data. Once the code snippets were prepared, I stored them in a MySQL database for easy querying and future analysis. My work involved ensuring the data was properly formatted and organized to support the subsequent evaluation of code quality. Through this experience, I learned a great deal about the intricacies of data handling, the importance of clean and structured data for research, and how LLM-generated code can be evaluated systematically. Additionally, I gained valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities in working with large datasets in the context of AI and machine learning research.
