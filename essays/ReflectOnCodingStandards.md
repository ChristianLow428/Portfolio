## First thoughts on "Coding Standards"
  When I first heard the term "coding standards," I thought it would be about trivial things such as indentation styles, bracket placement, etc. While it may seem like minor details, After working with ESLint for about a week, i've realized coding standards are much more than that. Coding standards are a giode to writing clear, more efficient, and easy to understand code.

## Initial Impressions 
  At first, getting ESLint up and running felt like a chore. I encountered warnings and errors that I didn’t fully understand, and fixing them sometimes felt like a chore. I asked myself, Why did it care so much about semicolons or spaces? However, as I worked through the issues, I started to see patterns in what ESLint was flagging. I noticed that they weren’t just random annoyances—they were signs of inconsistent style and potential logic issues wheen converting to an html format.


## Learning Curve
  One of the most frustrating parts of my experuence was figuring out the correct commands to install and use ESLint effectively. Even though we were given steps, my ESLint was being directed to a different source. However, Despite the struggle, this process forced me to become more comfortable with the command line which is an essential skill for a developer. I started to appreciate how ESLint integrates into the development, catching mistakes before they become bigger problems.


## Conclusion
  While my inital reaction to coding standards and ESLint was with frustration, I now understand its value after only a week of working with it. ESLint goes beyond just formatting but also massively improves code quality. Though the installation process and learning commands took more effort than I expected, it was a good experience. The benefits were clear and consise code. Going forward, I plan to embrace coding standards as an essential part of my development process, rather than viewing them as an obstacle.
