## Intro to Typescript

  Typescript is a completely new language to me. The only languages I was familiar with were C, Java, and Python. I felt that getting used to Typescript wasn't too hard because I'm used to programming languages that use static typing. To learn typescript I tried to go over the FreeCodeCamp assignment we were given in class until I had a basic grasp of typing with it. I also felt that using AI such as ChatGPT and Claude was very useful in my journey learning Typescript because I could use it as a teacher when I needed reminders on things such as how I'm supposed to its operators. Overall, I think Typescript is a great language for someone with prior coding experience. However, I still believe Python is the best language for complete beginners due to its simple syntax and minimal setup requirements.

## The introduction to WODs

  The WOD exercise was a straightforward yet effective introduction to both TypeScript and the concept of WODs. It required us to return a warning level based on the wind chill temperature, which made it a great beginner-friendly task. The implementation itself wasnâ€™t overly complicated, however, it did help me understand basic Typescript concepts like function definitions. I used AI on the WOD to check my work and make sure that my output matched the description of the assignment. I frequently use AI in my assignments, not just for ICS but for other courses as well. It serves as a helpful way to validate my understanding and correct any mistakes I might have made.

## Understanding Athletic Engineering

  Athletic software engineering is a completely new term to me, and the WODs are a great way to keep me active with my learning. I think the idea of breaking down coding sessions into short practice sessions is a good way to keep it engaging. That being said, I anticipate that some WODs later in the semester will be stressful, especially those that are more time-intensive. However, I still believe this approach will benefit me. Coding is a skill that requires both endurance and critical thinking, and WODs are designed to help build both.

## Final thoughts
  I feel the WODs are going to work for me even if it may stress me out. The practice WODs are also very helpful in getting an idea of what will happen in the real WOD. I'm someone who likes seeing progress and even if they become stressful, I see them as an effective way to develop problem-solving skills and improve my ability to code under pressure.
