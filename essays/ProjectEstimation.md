## 1. How did you make your effort estimates?
I made my effort estimates based on the complexity and scope of similar tasks I had worked on previously. For the Events page, which involved backend work like setting up routes, integrating with the database, and handling filtering and date formatting, I estimated it would take 180 minutes. This estimate was based on how long previous tasks with similar requirements had taken me. For the Club page, I thought it would be a bit simpler since it had a similar structure but fewer components. I initially estimated it would take 120 minutes, based on my experience with the Events page and assuming it would be easier.

## 2. Even though your estimates were always off, sometimes way off, was there any benefit from making effort estimates for the issues in advance? If so, what benefits? If not, why not?
Yes, there was clear benefit in making effort estimates in advance. While my estimates were often off, they helped me plan better and manage my time more effectively. For example, when I estimated 180 minutes for the Events page and later realized it took longer, it highlighted areas where I had underestimated complexity. Even though my estimate for the Club page of 120 minutes was also slightly off, having those numbers in place allowed me to track my progress and adjust my schedule as needed. It also helped the team stay aligned on expectations and manage dependencies between tasks.

## 3. Was there any benefit for tracking the actual effort expended on the issues? If so, what benefits? If not, why not? Was there any downside to estimating and tracking your effort? If so, what?
Tracking actual effort was highly beneficial. It allowed me to see the difference between my estimates and the actual time spent, which helped me refine my future estimates. For example, even though I estimated 180 minutes for the Events page, it actually took little longer, and tracking that extra time helped me adjust my approach for similar tasks in the future. Tracking actual effort also kept me focused and made me more mindful of how I was spending my time. The downside was the occasional interruption in my workflow when I had to manually log my time using a phone timer. However, the benefits of more accurate tracking far outweighed the minimal overhead.

## 4. How did you track your actual effort? How accurate do you believe your tracking was?
I used a physical phone timer to track my actual effort. Each time I started working on a task, I’d start the timer, and once I finished or took a break, I’d stop it. I felt this method was straightforward and reliable because it ensured I tracked only the actual time spent working, not idle time. I believe the overall tracking was pretty accurate. For non-coding tasks, I logged start and stop times manually in a notes app, which was a bit less precise but still gave a reasonable accounting of my time.

## 5. How much overhead was there in tracking your effort? Did it take up a noticeable amount of time or inhibit you working on the project?
The overhead was minimal. The phone timer method was easy to implement, and once I got used to it, it didn’t disrupt my workflow. The only time it felt like an inconvenience was when I forgot to stop the timer, which meant I had to go back and estimate the lost time later. Overall, the time spent tracking was minimal compared to the value it provided in helping me understand my work patterns. For non-coding tasks, I found logging the time in a notes app took only a minute or two and didn’t inhibit my progress on the project.
